**Problem** Show that $Q_n$ is symmetric ($Q_n = Q_n^⊤$) but not Hermitian ($Q_n ≠ Q_n^⋆$).

**Problem** Show that $Q_n^⋆$ can also be applied in $O(n \log n)$ operations.


**Problem 3.4**  A function with a jump does not have uniformly
converging coefficients. Plot interpolant for $\sign(θ-1/2)$.
Conjecture where the approximation converges. (This is known as
Gibb's phenomena.)
