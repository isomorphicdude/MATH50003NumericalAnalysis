## 1. Dense Matrices

**Problem 1.1** Show that `A*x` is not
implemented as `mul(A, x)` from the lecture notes
by finding a `Float64` example  where the bits do not match.




## 2. Triangular Matrices

**Problem 2.1** Complete the following function for performing
back-substitution with an upper-triangular matrix:
```julia
 function backsubstitution(U,b)
    n = size(U,1)
    
    if length(b) != n
        error("The system is not compatible")
    end
        
    x = zeros(n)  # the solution vector
    for k = n:-1:1  # start with k=n, then k=n-1, ...
        r = b[k]  # dummy variable
        for j = k+1:n
            ## TODO: update r using U[k,j] 
            r -= U[k,j]*x[j] # equivalent to r = r-U[k,j]*x[j]
        end
        ## TODO: Write to x[k]
        x[k] = r/U[k,k]
    end
    x
end
```

**Problem 2.2** Write a function `forwardsubstition` for performing
forward-substitution with a lower-triangular matrix:

## 4. Orthogonal matrices

**Problem (norm-preserving)** Show that orthogonal matrices preserve the 2-norm of vectors:
$$
\|Q 𝐯\| = \|𝐯\|.
$$

**SOLUTION**
$$
\|Q 𝐯\|^2 = (Q 𝐯)^⊤ Q 𝐯 = 𝐯^⊤ Q^⊤ Q 𝐯 = 𝐯^⊤  𝐯 = \|𝐯\|^2
$$
∎

**Theorem (eigenvalues of orthogonal matrix)** Show that the eigenvalues $λ$ of an orthogonal matrix $Q$ are
on the unit circle: $|λ| = 1$.

**SOLUTION**
Let $𝐯$ be a unit eigenvector corresponding to $λ$: $Q 𝐯 = λ 𝐯$ with $\|𝐯\| = 1$. Then
$$
1 = \| 𝐯 \| = \|Q 𝐯 \| =  \| λ 𝐯 \| = |λ|.
$$
∎

**Problem** Explain why an orthogonal matrix $Q$ must be equal to $I$ if all its eigenvalues are 1.
