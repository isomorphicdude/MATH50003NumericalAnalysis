    "## 1. Vector norms\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition (p-norm)**\n",
    "For $1 \\leq p < \\infty$ and $\\mathbf v \\in {\\mathbb R}^n$, define the $p$-norm:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\|\\mathbf{v}\\|_p := (\\sum_{k=1}^n |v_k|^p)^{1/p}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $v_k$ is the $k$-th entry of $\\mathbf v$. \n",

    " In Julia can use the inbuilt `norm` function to calculate norms:\n",
    " ```julia\n",
    " norm([1,-2,3]) == norm([1,-2,3],2) == sqrt(1^2+2^2+3^2);\n",
    " norm([1,-2,3],1) == sqrt(1 + 2 + 3)\n",

    "## 2. Matrix norms\n",
    " Just like vectors, matrices have norms that measure their \"length\".  The simplest example is the Fröbenius norm, \n",
    " defined for an $m \\times n$ real matrix $A$ as\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\|A\\|_F := \\sqrt{\\sum_{k=1}^m \\sum_{j=1}^n A_{kj}^2}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where ${\\rm vec}(A)$ is the equivalent of `vec(A)`, which \n",
    "\n",
    "While this is the simplest norm, it is not the most useful.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The important thing for us is that if $\\|A\\| = 0$ then $A = 0$, so it can be used to test if two matrices are equal: \n",
    "if $\\|A-B\\| \\approx 0$, then $A \\approx B$:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Induced matrix norms\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose $A$ is an $m \\times n$ matrix, and consider two norms $\\| \\mathbf v\\|_X$ for $\\mathbf v \\in \\mathbb R^m$  and \n",
    "$\\| \\matbf w \\|_Y$ for $\\mathbf w \\in \\mathbb R^n$.    For example, they could both be the 2-norm, both be the $\\infty$-norm, \n",
    "or a mixture of the two.  \n",
    "These two norms induce a norm on matrices:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\|A\\|_{X \\rightarrow Y} \\triangleq \\sup_{\\mathbf v : \\|\\mathbf{v}\\|_X=1} \\|A \\mathbf v\\|_Y$$\n",
    "\n",
    "That is, take the supremum of $\\|{A \\mathbf v}\\|_Y$ over the set of all vectors $\\mathbf v$ whose X-norm is one.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we use the same vector norm for the domain and range, we specify only one space\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\|A\\|_X \\triangleq \\|A\\|_{X \\rightarrow X}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For  the induced 2, 1, and $\\infty$-norm we use\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\|A\\|_2, \\|A\\|_1 \\qquad \\hbox{and} \\qquad \\|A\\|_{\\infty}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lemma (matrix norms are norms)** Matrix norms are norms, that is:\n",
    "1. $\\|c A \\| = |c| \\|A\\|$\n",
    "2. $\\| A + B \\| \\leq  \\|A\\| + \\|B\\|$\n",
    "3. $\\|A\\| =0 \\Rightarrow A = 0$\n",
    "In addition, they satisfy the additional property that\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\| AB\\| \\leq \\|A \\| \\|B\\|\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Proof**\n",
    "\n",
    "First note an equivalent definition of the induced norm:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\|A\\| = \\sup_{\\mathbf v} {\\|A \\mathbf v\\| \\over \\| \\mathbf v\\|}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "This follows since we can scale $\\mathbf v$ by its norm so that it has unit norm, that is,\n",
    "${\\mathbf v} \\over \\|\\mathbf v\\|$ has unit norm.  Then\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\sup_{\\mathbf v} {\\|A \\mathbf v\\| \\over \\| \\mathbf v\\|} = \n",
    "\\sup_{\\mathbf v} {\\|A {\\mathbf v \\over \\mathbf \\|\\mathbf v\\|}\\|} \\leq \\sup_{\\mathbf v : \\|\\mathbf w \\| = 1} {\\|A  w \\|} = \n",
    "\\|A\\|\n",
    "$$\n",
    "This combined with the trivial case\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\sup_{\\mathbf v} {\\|A \\mathbf v\\| \\over \\| \\mathbf v\\|} \\geq \\sup_{\\mathbf v : \\|\\mathbf v \\| = 1 } {\\|A \\mathbf v\\| \\over \\| \\mathbf v\\|}  = \n",
    "\\sup_{\\mathbf v : \\|\\mathbf v \\| = 1 } {\\|A \\mathbf v\\| } = \\|A\\|  \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Induced 2-norm\n",
    "\n",
    "Induced norms define the \"length\" of a matrix by how much they magnify vectors.  We can visualize this in 2D for the induced 2-norm $\\|A\\|_2$, taking a random 2 x 2 matrix."
